- Details should be refined but minimal

- Links: Underlined on hover, color shift from Forest to Indigo

### IMPLEMENTATION

This guide serves as the foundation for all Ghost Savvy Studios products and communications. It is designed to be practical and actionable, providing clear direction while allowing room for the creative innovation that defines our work.

The goal is consistency, not limitation—when in doubt, choose the cleaner, more refined approach that feels confidently minimal rather than decorative.
