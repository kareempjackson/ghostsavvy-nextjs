## üé® Reskin Guide

The project now supports easy reskinning through CSS variables. To customize the design:

### Quick Color Change

1. Open `src/app/globals.css`
2. Find the `@theme` block
3. Update the color variables:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand-deep: #your-color;
  --color-brand-indigo: #your-color;
  --color-brand-lime: #your-color;
  --color-brand-ivory: #your-color;
  --color-brand-black: #your-color;
  --color-brand-white: #your-color;
}
```

### Pre-made Themes

Check `docs/reskin-template.css` for 8 pre-made color schemes:

- Ocean Breeze
- Sunset Glow
- Forest Depths
- Purple Haze
- Monochrome Elegance
- Rose Gold
- Tech Blue
- Warm Earth

### Advanced Customization

- **Typography**: Update font variables in the `@theme` block
- **Spacing**: Modify custom spacing variables
- **Animations**: Adjust animation timing and easing
- **Components**: Update utility components like buttons and cards

See `docs/brand-guide.md` for complete customization instructions.

## Build Configuration

The project includes special configuration for production builds:

- **ESLint**: ESLint errors are ignored during production builds in `next.config.js`
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript errors are ignored during production builds in `next.config.js`
- **Tailwind v4**: Optimized CSS generation with automatic content detection

This ensures the application can be deployed even with minor linting or type errors. For local development, it's still recommended to fix all errors.

To run a build check:

```bash
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh
```
